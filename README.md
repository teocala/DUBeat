`DUBeat` is a C++ library that exploits [lifex][] and [deal.II][] to provide discontinuous Galerkin methods on simplices and their applications to cardiac electrophysiology.  
This work originates from a project for the course of *Advanced Programming for Scientific Computing* at *Politecnico di Milano* and it is developed by *Federica Botta* and *Matteo Calaf√†*.  

The library provides the following two methods:
1. Standard DGFEM.
2. DG with Dubiner basis.
